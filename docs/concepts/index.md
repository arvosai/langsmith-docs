# Conceptual Guide

This guide provides explanations of the key concepts behind LangSmith.

We recommend that you go through at least one of the [Tutorials](../tutorials/index.md) before diving into the conceptual guide. This will provide practical context that will make it easier to understand the concepts discussed here.

The conceptual guide does not cover step-by-step instructions or specific implementation examples â€” those are found in the [How-to guides](../how_to_guides/index.md) and [Tutorials](../tutorials/index.md). For detailed reference material, please see the API reference.
