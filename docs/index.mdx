# Getting started with LangSmith

## Introduction

**LangSmith** is a platform for building production-grade LLM applications. It allows you to closely monitor and evaluate your application, so you can ship quickly and with confidence. Use of LangChain is not necessary - LangSmith works on its own!

## Install LangSmith

We offer Python and Typescript SDKs for all your LangSmith needs.

<CodeTabs
  tabs={[
    {
      value: "python",
      label: "Python",
      language: "bash",
      content: `pip install -U langsmith`,
    },
    {
      value: "typescript",
      label: "TypeScript",
      language: "bash",
      content: `yarn add langchain langsmith`,
    },
  ]}
  groupId="client-language"
/>

## Create an API key

To create an API key head to the [setting pages](https://smith.langchain.com/settings). Then click **Create API Key.**

## Setup your environment

<ConfigureSDKEnvironmentCodeTabs />

## Log your first trace

<p>
  We provide multiple ways to log traces to LangSmith. Below, we'll highlight
  how to use <code>traceable</code>. See more on the{" "}
  <a href="./tracing/integrations">Integrations</a> page.
</p>
<CodeTabs
  tabs={[
    {
      value: "python",
      label: "Python",
      language: "python",
      content: PythonSDKTracingCode(),
    },
    {
      value: "typescript",
      label: "TypeScript",
      language: "typescript",
      content: TypeScriptSDKTracingCode(),
    },
  ]}
  groupId="client-language"

- Learn more about tracing on the [tracing page](/tracing).

## Create your first evaluation

Evalution requires a system to test, [data](evaluation/faq) to serve as test cases, and optionally evaluators to grade the results. Here we use a built-in accuracy evaluator.

<CodeTabs
  tabs={[
    PythonBlock(`from langsmith import Client
from langsmith.evaluation import evaluate

client = Client()

# Define dataset: these are your test cases

dataset_name = "Sample Dataset"
dataset = client.create_dataset(
    dataset_name, description="A sample dataset in LangSmith."
)
client.create_examples(
    inputs=[
        {"postfix": "to LangSmith"},
        {"postfix": "to Evaluations in LangSmith"},
    ],
    outputs=[
        {"output": "Welcome to LangSmith"},
        {"output": "Welcome to Evaluations in LangSmith"},
    ],
    dataset_id=dataset.id,
)

# Define your evaluator


def exact_match(run, example):
    return {"score": run.outputs["output"] == example.outputs["output"]}


experiment_results = evaluate(
    lambda input: "Welcome " + input["postfix"],  # Your AI system goes here
    data=dataset_name,  # The data to predict and grade over
    evaluators=[exact_match],  # The evaluators to score the results
    experiment_prefix="sample-experiment",  # The name of the experiment
    metadata={"version": "1.0.0", "revision_id": "beta"},
)
`),
    TypeScriptBlock(`import { Client, Run, Example } from "langsmith";
import { runOnDataset } from "langchain/smith";
import { EvaluationResult } from "langsmith/evaluation";

const client = new Client();

// Define dataset: these are your test cases
const datasetName = "Sample Dataset";
const dataset = await client.createDataset(datasetName, {
  description: "A sample dataset in LangSmith.",
});
await client.createExamples({
  inputs: [
    { postfix: "to LangSmith" },
    { postfix: "to Evaluations in LangSmith" },
  ],
  outputs: [
    { output: "Welcome to LangSmith" },
    { output: "Welcome to Evaluations in LangSmith" },
  ],
  datasetId: dataset.id,
});

// Define your evaluator
const exactMatch = async ({
  run,
  example,
}: {
  run: Run;
  example?: Example;
}): Promise<EvaluationResult> => {
  return {
    key: "exact_match",
    score: run.outputs?.output === example?.outputs?.output ? 1 : 0,
  };
};

await runOnDataset(
  (input: { postfix: string }) => ({ output: \`Welcome $\{input.postfix\}\` }), // Your AI system goes here
  datasetName, // The data to predict and grade over
  {
    evaluationConfig: { customEvaluators: [exactMatch] },
    projectMetadata: {
      version: "1.0.0",
      revision_id: "beta",
    },
  }
);
`),
]}
groupId="client-language"
/>

## FAQ

### How do I migrate projects between organizations?

Currently we do not support project migration betwen organizations. While you can manually imitate this by reading and writing runs and datasets using the SDK (see the querying runs and traces guide [here](/tracing/faq/querying_traces)), it will be fastest to create a new project within your organization and go from there.

### Why aren't my runs aren't showing up in my project?

If you aren't seeing any warnings when running your application, it may be that you are still using an API key from your "personal" organization. Check your most recent runs there to confirm by selecting your `Personal` tenant in the [settings](https://smith.langchain.com/settings) page and then viewing your [projects](https://smith.langchain.com/projects).

If you're still running into issues, please reach out to us at <a href="mailto:support@langchain.dev">support@langchain.dev</a>.

### My team deals with sensitive data that cannot be logged. How can I ensure that only my team can access it?

If you are interested in a private deployment of LangSmith or if you need to self-host, please reach out to us at <a href="mailto:sales@langchain.dev">sales@langchain.dev</a>. Self-hosting LangSmith requires an annual enterprise license that also comes with support and formalized access to the LangChain team.
