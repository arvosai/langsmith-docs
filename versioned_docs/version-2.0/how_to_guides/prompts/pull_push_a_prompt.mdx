# Push/pull a prompt

## Install packages

<HubInstallationCodeTabs />

## Configure environment variables

If you already have `LANGSMITH_API_KEY` set to your current workspace's api key from LangSmith, you can skip this step.

Otherwise, get an API key for your workspace by navigating to `Settings > API Keys > Create API Key` in LangSmith.

Set your environment variable.

```bash
export LANGCHAIN_HUB_API_KEY="lsv2_..."
```

## Pull a prompt and use it

You can pull your own private prompts and all of the public prompts in the LangChain Hub.

:::note SDK version
If you're using Python and encounter the error:
`Identifier must be in the format of owner/repo:commit or owner/repo`, you need to update your package version. You can do this by running:

`pip install -U langchainhub`
:::

To pull a **private prompt** or your own public prompt you do not need to specify the LangChain Hub handle (though you can, if you have one set).

To pull a **public prompt** from the LangChain Hub, you need to specify the handle of the prompt's author.

<PullPromptTabs />

You can also pull a specific commit of a prompt by specifying the commit hash.

```bash
prompt = hub.pull('my-private-prompt:12344e88')
publicPrompt = hub.pull("efriis/my-first-prompt:56489e79")
```

Here's an example of pulling a prompt from the LangChain Hub and using it in a runnable.

<HubPullCodeTabs />

## Push a prompt

You can push an update to an already-existing prompt or create a new one. If you specify a prompt name that exists in your workspace, a new version of your prompt will be committed.
If you specify a new prompt name, a new prompt will be created.

:::note Terminology
"Prompt" used to be called "repo", so any references to "repo" in the code are referring to a prompt.
