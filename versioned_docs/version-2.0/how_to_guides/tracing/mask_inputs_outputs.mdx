# Prevent logging of inputs and outputs in traces

In some situations, you may need to prevent the inputs and outputs of your traces from being logged for privacy or security reasons. LangSmith provides a way to filter the inputs and outputs of your traces before they are sent to the LangSmith backend.

If you want to completely hide the inputs and outputs of your traces, you can set the following environment variables when running your application:

```bash
LANGCHAIN_HIDE_INPUTS=true
LANGCHAIN_HIDE_OUTPUTS=true
```

This works for both the LangSmith SDK (Python and TypeScript) and LangChain.

You can also customize and override this behavior for a given `Client` instance. This can be done by setting the `hide_inputs` and `hide_outputs` parameters on the `Client` object.
For the example below, we will simply return an empty object for both `hide_inputs` and `hide_outputs`, but you can customize this to your needs.
